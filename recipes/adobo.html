            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In the Philippines, adobo is both a beloved cooking technique and a tangy marinated and braised meat dish. It's akin to the French coq au vin, but with a flavor all its own. You can use different types of meat or fish, but chicken is a favorite. Serve with steamed or fried rice.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups spiced cane vinegar</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups soy sauce</li>
                <li>¾ cup brewed coffee</li>
                <li>etc...</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together vinegar, soy sauce, coffee, and brown sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved.</li>
                <li>Heat coconut oil in an 8-quart Dutch oven over high heat. Working in batches, add chicken, skin sides down first, and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate.</li>
                <li>Drain all but 2 tablespoons drippings from Dutch oven and return to heat. Add chopped garlic and fry until light brown and crisp, about 3 minutes.
